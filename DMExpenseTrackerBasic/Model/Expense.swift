    - A String `category`
    - A  Double `amount`

    - `calculateTotalSpent`: Accepts an array of `Expense` and returns the total amount of money the user spent.
    - `getExpensesByCategory` Accepts an array of `Expense` and returns a dictionary where each key is a category and each value is an array of `Expense` belonging to that category.
